His body of work locates creativity at the intersection of humans and machines. In taking the data that flows around us as the primary material and the neural network of a computerized mind as a collaborator, Anadol paints with a thinking brush, offering us radical visualizations of our digitized memories and expanding the possibilities of architecture, narrative, and the body in motion. \\n Anadol’s site-specific AI data sculptures, live audio/visual performances, and immersive installations take many forms, while encouraging us to rethink our engagement with the physical world, its temporal and spatial dimensions, and the creative potential of machines. Machine Hallucinations – Mars : AI Data Paintings offer a new kind of cognitive cartography for data universes by using a neural network trained on 1.5 million archival photographic memories of HiRISE telescope of MRO Mars. A poetic journey in the mind of a machine explores vast synthetic landscapes of Mars to image a space yet reachable by humans. \\n Providing imaginary texture to this still unfamiliar place, Machine Hallucinations – Mars : AI Data Paintings illustrates a dreamscape of possible futures and hidden pasts. These machine-hallucinated AI Data Paintings come to represent collective memory, hidden layers of history, and then consciousness of a planet that, otherwise, might remain unseen. \\n HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment) is the most powerful camera ever sent to another planet, one of six instruments onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. It was launched in 2005, arrived at Mars in 2006, and have been imaging ever since. MRO's camera’s high resolution capability (imaging up to 30 centimeters per pixel) remains unprecedented for any existing orbiter in the study of the Red Planet, as well as being an indispensable instrument for helping to select landing sites for robotic and future human exploration. \\n Resolution : 10200 x 13200PX. Generated from 32Bit EXR format. \\n EACH OPEN EDITION COMES WITH A PHYSICAL PRINT! ''17 x ''22 inches.",

His works deftly interweave cyberpunk elements with the beauty and freedom of nature.

Over the last two years he has created artworks for Run The Jewels, Deadmau5, Jabbawockeez, Conor McGregor, Maroon 5 and Chromeo. His first and only IRL exhibit was AFTERL-IFE WORLD at the Diesel Art Gallery in Tokyo Sept-Nov 2019.",

Maller has had a celebrated career pushing the boundaries of the digital medium as an independent artist. Since founding seminal art collective Depthcore in 2002, he has created work for clients including Nike, Gatorade, The Grammys, Dolby, LG, Jordan and Under Armour. Building on this success, Maller’s groundbreaking, year-long project ‘Facets’ forged an iconic brand cemented in his trademark geometric approach. This style has had a visible and lasting influence on visual art practice around the world. \\n - \\n Artist's Statement \\n I created the majority of “The Second Storm” in Australian hotel quarantine, after flying from Los Angeles to see my mother at the end of her battle with cancer. I was escorted by the military from the airport to a hotel room where I would spend two weeks alone in confinement. Around the same time I landed, mum checked in to hospital for the last time. \\n  I spent those two weeks creating this artwork as I sought to come to terms. To terms with mums life ending. To terms with being locked in a room with so little time left. To terms with life and death and grief and love and everything in between.",

In the past his artistic work was mainly in the field of oil painting. At the beginning of 2020 he reinvented himself and forced himself in his work mainly into the digital field and especially into the crypto art and NFT scene, in which he quickly flourished and gained a wider recognition. PR1MAL CYPHER was born. His work is largely inspired by the Vaporwave and Outrun art, as his passion has been CYBERPUNK since his early youth. He sees in it not only a graceful aesthetic. Cyberpunk is much more — a bridge of the present and its technical innovations and ambitions to different scenarios of the future of mankind, which will be significantly influenced by technology. The reference to the Cypherpunk, Anonymous and also Blockchain movement is thus clearly reflected in his works and is of crucial importance. Welcome back to the second part of the \"ART OF RESISTANCE\" series, which actually accompany a multi-part article series published in Bitcoin Magazine. This second collection is a preview of the soon to be published articles and features a rich array of different works that have been kept low in terms of limitation, which is why the most circulated artworks have only 25 editions. As in the first part of the series, the special \"Hackers Green Editions\" have only 10 editions per Cypherpunk portrait and even less as far as the other images are concerned.",
                            "storeDescription2": "PR1MAL CYPHER currently is one of the few crypto artists to mainly use a neon color scheme. Since he has began tokenizing his artwork, he has become recognizable for this color scheme and it has evolved into his brand. The neon artwork pops of the screen with vibrant colors and beautiful details.",

Over the last two years he has created artworks for Run The Jewels, Deadmau5, Jabbawockeez, Conor McGregor, Maroon 5 and Chromeo. His first and only IRL exhibit was AFTERL-IFE WORLD at the Diesel Art Gallery in Tokyo Sept-Nov 2019.",

Kalyan will also be listing all 9 panels together as a 1 of 1 for auction. Each artwork listed is animated - unlike his first collection which was completely still. We are thrilled to have Kalyan back on Nifty Gateway and look forward to his progress with digital art!",

While each artwork featured is a painting, Kalyan took it a step further and animated each panel. Welcome back Kalyan!",

His first and only IRL exhibit was AFTERL-IFE WORLD in Tokyo Sept-Nov 2019. His NG collection will be his first ever tokenized artworks!\r\n\\n\r\nIf you are one of the first 5 users to collect 'Thought as a system' and 'Ideas r the currency', you can claim a copy of 'Did you ever really love me?' at niftygateway.com/redemptions.

His works deftly interweave cyberpunk elements with the beauty and freedom of nature. As a lover of the wilderness, which was ever present where he grew up, he brings a fresh thematic to the metropolitan aesthetic, done up in citrus and neon tones of technology somehow rendered as a space naturally human. Over the last two years he has created artworks for Run The Jewels, Deadmau5, Jabbawockeez, Conor McGregor, Maroon 5 and Chromeo. His first and only IRL exhibit was AFTERL-IFE WORLD at the Diesel Art Gallery in Tokyo Sept-Nov 2019.",

Maller has had a celebrated career pushing the boundaries of the digital medium as an independent artist. Since founding seminal art collective Depthcore in 2002, he has created work for clients including Nike, Gatorade, The Grammys, Dolby, LG, Jordan and Under Armour. Building on this success, Maller’s groundbreaking, year-long project ‘Facets’ forged an iconic brand cemented in his trademark geometric approach. This style has had a visible and lasting influence on visual art practice around the world. \\n - \\n Artist's Statement \\n I created the majority of “The Second Storm” in Australian hotel quarantine, after flying from Los Angeles to see my mother at the end of her battle with cancer. I was escorted by the military from the airport to a hotel room where I would spend two weeks alone in confinement. Around the same time I landed, mum checked in to hospital for the last time. \\n  I spent those two weeks creating this artwork as I sought to come to terms. To terms with mums life ending. To terms with being locked in a room with so little time left. To terms with life and death and grief and love and everything in between.",

We could not be more excited to host him for his first even tokenized collection.

His body of work locates creativity at the intersection of humans and machines. In taking the data that flows around us as the primary material and the neural network of a computerized mind as a collaborator, Anadol paints with a thinking brush, offering us radical visualizations of our digitized memories and expanding the possibilities of architecture, narrative, and the body in motion. \\n Anadol’s site-specific AI data sculptures, live audio/visual performances, and immersive installations take many forms, while encouraging us to rethink our engagement with the physical world, its temporal and spatial dimensions, and the creative potential of machines. Machine Hallucinations – Mars : AI Data Paintings offer a new kind of cognitive cartography for data universes by using a neural network trained on 1.5 million archival photographic memories of HiRISE telescope of MRO Mars. A poetic journey in the mind of a machine explores vast synthetic landscapes of Mars to image a space yet reachable by humans. \\n Providing imaginary texture to this still unfamiliar place, Machine Hallucinations – Mars : AI Data Paintings illustrates a dreamscape of possible futures and hidden pasts. These machine-hallucinated AI Data Paintings come to represent collective memory, hidden layers of history, and then consciousness of a planet that, otherwise, might remain unseen. \\n HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment) is the most powerful camera ever sent to another planet, one of six instruments onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. It was launched in 2005, arrived at Mars in 2006, and have been imaging ever since. MRO's camera’s high resolution capability (imaging up to 30 centimeters per pixel) remains unprecedented for any existing orbiter in the study of the Red Planet, as well as being an indispensable instrument for helping to select landing sites for robotic and future human exploration. \\n Resolution : 10200 x 13200PX. Generated from 32Bit EXR format. \\n EACH OPEN EDITION COMES WITH A PHYSICAL PRINT! ''17 x ''22 inches.",

After discovering FEWOCiOUS’ portfolio while exploring the world of digital art, Two Feet was captivated by their work. Serendipitously, FEWOCiOUS happened to be a long time fan of Two Feet and the two decided to collaborate on several pieces of audiovisual artwork. Two Feet wrote and recorded the music for the pieces in addition to drawing the 2d versions of the hand/head. FEWOCiOUS’ playful style added a colorful, vibrant spin to the drawings while bringing the collection to life with their eccentric animations.",

CHAOS can be understood as a driving force of nature, a logic hidden deep within mathematics, a philosophy of life or a counterpoint to order and civility. Chaos is deeply rooted in all creative endeavors as a necessary energy for change. We live through and survive chaos in our daily lives, and we try to interpret it to understand the universe around us. As artists from a developing country, these creators live surrounded by chaos, sometimes struggling with it, sometimes thriving from it. Each artwork in this project is a creative interpretation with the individual perspective of each artist, creating a once in a lifetime compendium that brings a new perspective on the possibilities and perils of CHAOS. It is the biggest ever collaboration in the history of Nifty Gateway.",
