Her work balances between concept and commercial realms spanning across various industries including music, fashion and tech. Her subject matter touches upon themes of the subconscious, nature and vices iterated into lighthearted, dreamlike compositions. Blake's work is recognized for its vibrant palettes and ethereal undertones with a surreal futurist aesthetic. \\n \"Four Winds\" invites you into a world ruled by the seasons. Four queens, each representing a specific season and a directional wind, share a castle from which they oversee a realm that reflects their own unique style and personality. Mora Borea, the north wind, the winter wind that bites. Zephone Brigita, the west wind, the gentle breeze of spring. Onye Nota, the south wind, the beating swelter of summer. Eurina Demisa, the east wind, the autumn gale of change. Taking turns with the seasons, the throne bows and shifts to their will during each queen's tenure. Crowned in masks to represent their wind's animal familiar, the queens flourish for their season, then perish at the sight of their successor; only to return again with the winds are in their favor. Four Winds. Four Queens. Four familiar masks. One throne. Which season will you find most bountiful?",

Maller has had a celebrated career pushing the boundaries of the digital medium as an independent artist. Since founding seminal art collective Depthcore in 2002, he has created work for clients including Nike, Gatorade, The Grammys, Dolby, LG, Jordan and Under Armour. Building on this success, Maller’s groundbreaking, year-long project ‘Facets’ forged an iconic brand cemented in his trademark geometric approach. This style has had a visible and lasting influence on visual art practice around the world. \\n - \\n Artist's Statement \\n I created the majority of “The Second Storm” in Australian hotel quarantine, after flying from Los Angeles to see my mother at the end of her battle with cancer. I was escorted by the military from the airport to a hotel room where I would spend two weeks alone in confinement. Around the same time I landed, mum checked in to hospital for the last time. \\n  I spent those two weeks creating this artwork as I sought to come to terms. To terms with mums life ending. To terms with being locked in a room with so little time left. To terms with life and death and grief and love and everything in between.",
